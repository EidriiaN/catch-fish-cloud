# FishingLakes Application Development Plan

## Project Overview

A web application for connecting fishermen with private fishing lakes. The platform allows lake administrators to list their lakes/ponds and manage reservations, while fishermen can discover, book, and review fishing locations.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React (JavaScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Custom auth during development → Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase (Firestore)
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap → Google Maps API
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Components & Implementation Notes

### Authentication

- Start with custom mock authentication
- Later transition to Firebase Authentication
- Support email/password, Google, and potentially Facebook login
- Role-based access control (user vs admin)

### Lake Listing

- Filterable, searchable grid of lakes
- Sort by price, rating, distance
- Map view option with lake markers
- List view with card design

### Accessibility

- ✅ Proper color contrast for readability
  - ✅ Enhanced text contrast on light backgrounds (gray-500 → gray-700)
  - ✅ Improved button text visibility in all states (disabled, hover)
  - ✅ Fixed low-contrast placeholder text
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader compatible components

### Maps Integration

- Start with Leaflet.js for development
- Draw lake boundaries and ponds as polygons
- Allow administrators to define and edit pond areas
- Show availability on the map with color coding
- Later transition to Google Maps for production

### Reservation System

- Calendar-based availability checking
- Pond-specific booking
- Payment integration (placeholder for now)
- Confirmation emails
- Cancellation policies

### Mobile Considerations

- Responsive design for all pages
- Touch-friendly map interactions
- Simplified booking flow on small screens
- Optimized images and assets

## Mock Data Strategy

- Use detailed mock data during development
- Structure mock data to mirror Firebase Firestore
- Create helper functions that can be swapped for Firebase later
- Include realistic scenarios: reservations, reviews, etc.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- In-app messaging between users and lake owners
- Weather integration for fishing conditions
- Fish stocking schedules and notifications
- Subscription plans for lake owners
- Mobile app versions
