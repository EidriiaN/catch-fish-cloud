# FishingLakes Application Development Plan

## Project Overview

A web application for connecting fishermen with private fishing lakes. The platform allows lake administrators to list their lakes/ponds and manage reservations, while fishermen can discover, book, and review fishing locations.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React (JavaScript)
- **Styling**: Chakra UI (migrated from Tailwind CSS)
- **Authentication**: Custom auth during development â†’ Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase (Firestore)
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap â†’ Google Maps API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
